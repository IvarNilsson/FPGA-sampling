Welcome to the Acoustic Warfare FPGA-samling github!

Information about the project and user guid on how to build and run the project is found under the [Project Wiki](../../wiki).

A more comprehencive discription of all the diffrent components of the project can be found in the [Project Report](/doc/acoustic_warfare_fpga_sampling.pdf).

All test and results were done on PCB-A2 version one (the version without buffers).
